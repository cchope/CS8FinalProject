   <h1> Our First, Our Manager: Stanhope Nwosu </h1>
   <img src="images/croppedStan.jpg" alt="" class="stan">
   <p> This here is the project manager, Stanhope Nwosu. Stanhope is an up and coming junior who is about to enter the wonderful realm of Computer Science. He, originally coming into this University as a Biological Science major, he realized he wanted more to do. He wanted to learn how to build and start his own kind of programs and games. This started as a small interest but came into a bigger idea as time went on.
   He is an avid fan of  most games and media, mainly PlayStation games like Borderlands. He also knows how to play a few instruments as well, such as the trumpet, recorder, piano and some harmonica. 
   He hails, born and raised, from the good ol' Bronx, New York. An avid fan of most music, he loves to listen and make more of his own play lists most of the time. 
   An open book, our manager is one that does not force or take charge, but involves the entire group in ways that try to incorporate our ideas and voices.
   Lets think about the designs, and mash the parts we all can agree and would like to see made into reality was his first action as the project manager.
