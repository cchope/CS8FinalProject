<h1 class='heading'>Welcome to your snack filled paradise!</h1>
<p class='p1'>Welcome to UVMeats!  This idea was brought to light by our project manager Stanhope, his idea was to incorporate clubs on campus who sell food and make a page that students could order from.  In short this page helps bring snacks to our hungry UVM students.
    Above you will find the page navigation which will lead you food options from different clubs each club is selling food for a purpose and that reason is listed on their page.  Click on a link in the nav bar and you will be lead to another page which has an order form and a short history of the club and why they are selling food.  Options range from 
    cookies to donuts to nachos to even grilled cheese!  Explore the page and place your order today!</p>

<h1 class="heading2">Why are we doing this?</h1>
<p class='p2'>So I know you've walked in your building and have seen fliers about food on campus.  They usually read "text this number to place your order."  And although it works well its not efficient.  Fliers 
fall off or people can rip them off the wall or you could just not even see them since most are posted in black and white ink.  Also what if you saw a flier and forgot to save the number now you have to leave your room 
head to the floor where you saw it, text them and head back to your room.  Thats too much work, we're in college we are lazy, tired and stressed.  With UVMeats you have food literally at 
your finger tips, no need to leave your bed, there are a variety of snacks do order right on that expensive Mac you saved up for.  And the best part orders arrive within 20 minutes! </p>

<h1 class="heading3"> Clubs involved </h1>
<img src="images/intervarsity.jpeg" alt="Intervarsity Group photo" class='pic3'> <img src="images/feelgoodlogo.png" alt="feelgood logo" class="pic4"> <img src="images/outing club.png" alt="The outing club" class='pic2'>

<p class="p3">We have collaborated with four clubs already to help spread the love and great taste across the campus. Some of these clubs and organizations include Intervarsity, Feel Good, The Outing Club, and Alana Gear. 
   They each have made food, sweets and some delectable treats for any campus and UVM student that they can help. 
     For example, Intervarsity is out and about, baking sheets of cookies, chocolate chip to snicker doodles. Our own on-campus Christian ministry group bakes and they can bake well! 
    They usually get over crowed in orders for their cookies, some of which they also give out for some that could not afford even a half dozen. 
    Truly a group with big hearts and even sweeter cookies! They typically have their late night cookie orders up for take starting from 9pm all the way to midnight on the dot.
    The next up and coming days for deliveries are set for the 2nd and 4th Fridays and Saturdays of September and November and the 3rd weekend of October. Remember when your feeling the past 8pm cookie hunger.
        And for only $3 for half a dozen and a full dozen for only $5, let the Cookie Monsters eat! 

    
     When people think about cheese, their minds are off to grilled cheese sandwiches. And when you think about grilled cheeses, none other than Feel Good comes to the minds of every UVM campus student. 
    They make their sandwiches with love, flavor and all the best things a sandwich can need. Nothing brings a lunch/snack hungry college student the joy their grilled cheeses bring. 
    With a Plane Jane for simple bite or a nice Maple Staple for a treat-your-self day, Feel Good got what you need. And what's more, it's all donation based, with the recommendation of only $4-5 per sandwich. 
        At theses prices, why wouldn't you grab one while they last. 
    
    
    Another favorite for hungry college kids with a good sweet tooth, Alana Gear. They love their hikes, climbs and trail blazing and love glazing some donuts too. 
    They have a variety of tasty donuts that you can imagine. Mainly of the Krispy Kremes to Dunkin Ds, let's not forget the nice and local Koffee Kup Bakery. 
    Running over the treacherous campus, hindered by neither rain, nor shine, slush or mud, theyâ€™ve set to reach for your donut needs. 
    With a half dozen for $5 and and whole baked dozen for $8, these are deals that cannot be overlooked. 
    
    In the Outing Club, people are prepared to go out in the wilderness to enjoy the warmth and kindness of nature. And if they could do that with a few nachos too that's even better. 
    Outing Clubs nachos have gotten some buzz around campus and it's time for the buzz to go up. Let's go out and party wild with the wildest nachos UVM has!! <
