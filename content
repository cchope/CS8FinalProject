This is new content for Amnesty International

All people have fundamental human rights. But those rights are abused or denied every single day. 
When that happens, Amnesty International finds the facts, exposes what’s happening, and rallies people together to force governments and others to respect everyone’s human rights.
And we get results.
Last year alone, Amnesty International helped free 153 people who were wrongfully imprisoned because of who they are or what they believe – 
and we changed laws in dozens of countries on refugees, reproductive rights, LGBT equality, free speech, the death penalty, and other critical human rights issues. 
From start to finish, our work focuses on the individual – people whose human rights are abused, and people who have the power to change the world.
We received the Nobel Peace Prize for our life-saving work.
