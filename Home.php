<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
<p>So I know you've walked in your building and have seen fliers about food on campus.  And although it works well its not efficient.  Fliers 
fall off or people can rip them off the wall.  Also what if you saw a flier and forgot to save the number now you have to leave your room 
head to the floor where you saw it and text them.  Thats too much work, we're in college we are lazy.  With UVMeats you have food literally at 
your finger tips and orders arrive within 20 minutes. </p>


<h2> Clubs involved </h2> 
<p>We have collaborated with four clubs already to help spread the love and great taste across the campus. Some of these clubs and organziations include Intervarsity, Feel Good, The Outing Club, and Alana Gear. 
   They each have made food, swwets and some delectable treats for any campus and UVM student that they can help. 
    
    For example, Intervarsity is out and about, baking sheets of cookies, chcolatee chip to snickerdoodles.
    Our own on-campus Christain misnrty group bakes and they can bake well! 
    They usually get overcrowed in orders for their cookies, some of which they also give out for some that could not afford even a half dozen. 
    Truly a group with big hearts and even sweeter cookies! They typically have their late night cookie orders up for take starting from 9pm all the way to midnight on the dot. The next up and coming days for deliveries are set for the 2nd and 4th Fridays and Saturdays of September and November and the 3rd weekend of October. Remember when your feeling the past 8pm cookie hunger.

    
    
    Another favorite for feeding the campus is Alana Gear. Not only do they know how to hike, climb and bblaze them forest trails, but they also know how 
    
    
    But please do not think that we will only keep just to these few groups. 
   We hope to include as many other that want to join our site. We'd love to add on the list of clubs that would like to have a site easy to access for ordering and delivery.
