<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
<p>So I know you've walked in your building and have seen fliers about food on campus.  And although it works well its not efficient.  Fliers 
fall off or people can rip them off the wall.  Also what if you saw a flier and forgot to save the number now you have to leave your room 
head to the floor where you saw it and text them.  Thats too much work, we're in college we are lazy.  With UVMeats you have food literally at 
your finger tips and orders arrive within 20 minutes. </p>


<h2> Clubs involved </h2> 
<p>We have collaborated with four clubs Intervarsity, Feel Good, The Outing Club, and Alana Gear.  These clubs are all selling different
   foods for your consumption.   </p>
